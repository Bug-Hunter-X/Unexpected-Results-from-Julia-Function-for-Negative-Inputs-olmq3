# Julia Function Bug

This repository contains a Julia function that exhibits unexpected behavior for negative inputs. The function `myfunction` is intended to square positive inputs and return the negative of negative inputs. However, it does not handle the case of zero correctly and could potentially throw errors if not handled appropriately.  The solution demonstrates how to properly handle the edge case for zero and provides more robust error handling. 

## Bug Report

The original function fails to produce the expected output when passed a negative value. It also lacks explicit handling for zero, which leads to unexpected results depending on how it is handled internally (it should likely return 0).

## Solution

The solution file provides a corrected version of the function, adding explicit handling for the case where x is equal to 0, ensuring correct results are returned for all input cases, regardless of whether it is positive, negative or zero.
